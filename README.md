Welcome to `IslandTime`!
This Workflow allows you to extract and analyse satellite images and localised time series for small coral reef islands in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). It uses a combination of multiple existing packages and modules, including `Rbeast` for time seriesdec and `CoastSat`. 
Note that the Workflow is currently tailored to analyse coral reef islands located in the Maldives, but we are working on expanding the analysis usability to other SIDS.

## How to use from scratch?
